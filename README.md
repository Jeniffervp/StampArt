This is an e-commerce application that focuses on the sale of custom hoodies, to facilitate the creation of a unique product for each customer, but at the same time, it facilitates the mass sale of the most popular hoodies, you can make your own designs.
Made with the middle stack, we choose these technologies because they are very popular in the web development sector.

In this project, we had joy, sadness and many learning moments, our emotions are well represented in the image above.


## Technologies

This application was created with ** React **, which is a library written in JavaScript, developed on Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive and reusable components for user interfaces. It is used on Facebook for component production, and Instagram is written entirely in React. One of its highlights is that it is not only used on the client side, but it can also be represented on the server and work together, after an investigation that we discover is the perfect technology for our Frontend development

In the Backend we use Express.js, a node.js Framework, our first choice was between pure node.js and using a framework, with express it will take 5-10x less time and lines of code because you don't have to repeat same code over and over again.


## How to use it? 

- Make sure you have installed these versions of node (node ​​v12.10.0) and npm (npm 6.10.3)
- Clone the github repository on your computer (the recommended operating system is windows 10) 
````git clone https://github.com/yawzyag/StampArt````
- Enter the BackEnd folder, in this folder you can find all the Express development
- once inside, run on the command line **npm i** to install dependencies
- When all are installed, you can run the application with **node app.js**
- You will have a message like the following:
application listening at the port: 5000!
Connected to the database
- You are now running the backend, all endpoints are ready, so now you must return and then enter the FrontEnd folder, in this folder you can find the React development
- once inside, run the compass line **npm i** to install dependencies
- when they finish installing, you can run the application with **npm start**
- The application will start and show you a message like this
Successfully compiled!

Now you can see stampart in the browser.

Local: http: // localhost: 3000 /
